# checkIt

## What would it do?

The main goal for checkit is to automatically check AA non rev passengers in with a completely automated system. Doing so entails:
1.  Gathering a list of all the listings that the person has created
2.  Determining when the checkin time for that listing is
3.  Sending requests to checkin to a flight once the time is close.

The use case:
As stanby passengers at AA, wheither or not you're sleeping in an airport is largely determined by your checkin time. The earlier you checkin, the higher you are on the list. Now this kinda sucks since good practice says to take the 5am flight every time, making you have to wake up 5-ish minutes sooner and complete a task.
    Now that's hard because:
    -   Waking up at 5 am to checkin?
        -   What if I went hard the night before, should I be punished for that?
    -   What if I'm overseas and don't have immediate access to the internet?
    -   In order to help my friends buddy pass out I'd also have to be responsible for them too
    -   There are probably more but I don't know them off the top of my head.
